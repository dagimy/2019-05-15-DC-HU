  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment

  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

        (found in

        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
